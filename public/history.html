    <h2>1950s</h2>
    <p>
      Formula 1, the pinnacle of motorsport, officially began in 1950 with the inaugural FIA World Championship. The first season featured races like the British Grand Prix at Silverstone and included drivers such as Giuseppe Farina and Juan Manuel Fangio. In its early years, the sport was dominated by Italian manufacturers like Alfa Romeo and Ferrari. The decade laid the foundation for the global appeal of F1, with cars evolving from pre-World War II designs to more competitive, purpose-built machines.

    <h2>1960s</h2>
    <p>
      The 1960s saw the rise of iconic teams and drivers, with Stirling Moss, Jim Clark, and Jackie Stewart becoming household names. The era was marked by technological innovation, including the introduction of rear-engine cars by teams like Lotus. It was also a time of intense competition, with the dominant drivers and teams shifting regularly. The safety concerns of the decade highlighted the need for improved regulations, especially after the tragic deaths of drivers such as Lorenzo Bandini and Jim Clark.

    <h2>1970s</h2>
    <p>
      The 1970s was a transformative decade for F1, as turbocharged engines and aerodynamics began to shape car design. Drivers like Niki Lauda, James Hunt, and Mario Andretti dominated the scene. The rivalry between Hunt and Lauda became legendary, reaching a climax in the 1976 season, which was later immortalized in the film Rush. The sport also saw increasing commercial interest and the introduction of sponsorships, making F1 more profitable and visible to a global audience. However, safety remained a major issue, leading to improvements in car design and race regulations.

    <p>
      The 1990s were defined by the era of dominant teams and legendary rivalries, with Michael Schumacher emerging as a force to be reckoned with, especially after joining Ferrari. The decade also saw technological advancements such as traction control, electronic systems, and more aerodynamically refined cars. Teams like Williams, McLaren, and Ferrari battled for the championship, and the driver rivalry between Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen captured much of the public's attention. F1 expanded its global footprint with more races in emerging markets, while the introduction of the 3.5-liter V10 engines increased the sport's technological complexity.

      The 2000s were dominated by Michael Schumacher, whose dominance with Ferrari resulted in five consecutive championships from 2000 to 2004. F1 became increasingly commercialized, with multi-million-dollar sponsorship deals and a growing global fan base. The sport also saw increased focus on technology, with tire wars between manufacturers and further advancements in aerodynamics. In 2005, Fernando Alonso’s victory for Renault marked the end of Schumacher's dominance, setting the stage for a more competitive era. The decade also saw efforts to improve safety with the introduction of the Halo system and stronger crash tests.
